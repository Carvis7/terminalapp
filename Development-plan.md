##Puppy Virtual Pet

For my terminal app assignment I will develop a virtual pet mini game.

The aim is to keep the pet alive and make it love you 100%.

The pet will be either a dog or a cat.

You will adopt the pet and then need to meet its needs by walking, cleaning, feeding and even picking up its poop.

The game will work on a continuous loop until the pet dies.

The player can continue playing after reaching a 'love' value of 100 or more. Thus, if the pet doesn't die, it is possible to play forever.

###Character (Puppy)

Character will be various breeds of puppies.

###*-Breeds* (__Removed Feature__)
* German Shepherd
* Labrador
* Jack Russell
* Dalmation

***Maybe can add a rare breed if time permits?*

___

###Needs

Puppy will need the following list of actions associated with it:
* Feed
* Walk
* Bathe
---

##Menu

* New Game
* Exit

---

## Game Details

The game will feature 'points'.
* Health Points (HP)
* Love Points
* Hunger Points

The Health Points will be the most important.
If the HP falls below 0, the pet will die and the player will fail.
It will result in a game over.

If the Love Points reach 100+ the player is congratulated and has basically won the game although they can keep playing.

## UI

The user will be given choices that need user input in each section of the game (Main menu, Main game area).

The choices will require the user to enter the corresponding key.
Example:

    (N)ew Game
    (E)xit

If the player wishes to exit the game, they would press the 'e' key on their keyboard.

###Status Updates

- Couldn't get breed selector to work.
scrapped the whole feature.


- Unable to fix limitation on pet stats to 0 and 100
keep getting error messages or the program completely ignores it altogether.
This isn't necessarily bad.
The pet still dies and the user gets game over if the pet health falls below 0.
The user is also able to keep playing the game after reaching a pet love of 100, so the fact that the score on that can continue growing is good for continuity.

- Tested the application and everything appears to run smoothly.
The dice roll feature is entertaining with the random events that follow.
The game is fun.
I would like to implement more features in the future.
